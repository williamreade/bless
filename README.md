Banded Linear Equation System Solver
Although linear equation system solvers have been extensively treated, the state of the art for large equation systems -the blocking algorithm- does not have to be the end of the line. The author proposes the use of binary trees for very large systems, obtaining a far superior, timeeffective result. A computer test-program shows the advantages of the method. The paper concludes that the proposed tool could open new horizons to research in the fields of artificial intelligence and neural analysis.
